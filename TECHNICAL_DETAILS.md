# Technical Details: Prediction System & Learning Mechanism

## Prediction System Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### LSTM Neural Network
- Input shape: (30, 5) - 30 days of historical data with 5 features
- Architecture:
  - LSTM Layer 1: 50 units with dropout (0.2)
  - LSTM Layer 2: 30 units with dropout (0.2)
  - Dense output layer: 1 unit
- Optimization: Adam optimizer with MSE loss

#### Technical Indicators
- Moving Averages (20, 50, 200 days)
- RSI (14-period)
- MACD (12, 26, 9)
- Bollinger Bands (20, 2Ïƒ)

### 2. Signal Generation

#### Feature Engineering
```python
Features used:
- Price data (OHLCV)
- Technical indicators
- Price momentum
- Volatility metrics
- Volume analysis
```

#### Signal Strength Calculation
- Combines multiple indicators
- Weighted scoring system:
  - MA crossovers
  - RSI extremes
  - MACD signals
  - Volume confirmation
- Confidence calculation based on signal agreement

### 3. Incremental Learning System

#### Background Learning Process
- Runs in a separate thread
- Continuously updates model weights
- Adapts to new market conditions
- Maintains a rolling window of recent data

#### Learning Algorithm
1. Data Collection:
   - Stores last 1000 price movements
   - Features: price, indicators, volume
   - Labels: actual price changes

2. Training Process:
   - Batch size: 32 samples
   - Updates every 5 minutes
   - Uses most recent data points
   - Applies gradient updates

3. Adaptation Mechanism:
   - Adjusts to market volatility
   - Updates signal thresholds
   - Modifies confidence levels
   - Fine-tunes prediction weights

### 4. Signal Validation

#### Entry Points
- Strong buy signals require:
  - RSI < 30 (oversold)
  - Positive MACD crossover
  - Price above key moving averages
  - High volume confirmation

#### Exit Points
- Sell signals triggered by:
  - RSI > 70 (overbought)
  - MACD bearish crossover
  - Break below support levels
  - Divergence patterns

### 5. Performance Metrics

#### Backtesting Engine
- Simulates trading strategy
- Calculates key metrics:
  - Total return
  - Win rate
  - Maximum drawdown
  - Risk-adjusted returns

#### Real-time Validation
- Monitors prediction accuracy
- Adjusts confidence levels
- Updates signal thresholds
- Maintains performance stats
